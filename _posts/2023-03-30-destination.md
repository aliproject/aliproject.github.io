4. Taman Hiburan (Amusement Parks) is the most popular category with 135 destinations, followed by Budaya (Cultural Destinations) with 117 destinations, and Cagar Alam (Nature Reserves) with 106 destinations.

5. Bahari (Marine Destinations) and Tempat Ibadah (Religious Sites) have a relatively smaller number of destinations compared to other categories, which could indicate potential for growth in these areas.

6. The three identified tourism destinations with the highest number of visits (Wisata Lereng Kelir, Wisata Mangrove Tapakn, and Wot Batu) could potentially be popular among tourists and may warrant further investigation and development.
